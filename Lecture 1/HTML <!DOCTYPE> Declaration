HTML <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
Definition and Usage
All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
<!DOCTYPE html>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
Examples
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!DocType html>
<!Doctype html>
<!doctype html>
