HTML <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
<!DOCTYPE html>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
Examples
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!DocType html>
<!Doctype html>
<!doctype html>

HTML <html> Tag
The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).

HTML <head> Tag
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
<title> (required in every HTML document)
<style>
<base>
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>

HTML <body> Tag
The <body> tag defines the document's body.
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.
